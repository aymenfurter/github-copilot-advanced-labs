# Lab 0: Calculator App Development (Copilot Edits)

## Phase 1: All-in-One File

In the first phase, you will create a single HTML file that includes:
  
1. **HTML Structure** for the Calculator UI
2. **Embedded CSS** for styling the calculator
3. **Inline JavaScript** to implement the calculator logic

### Exercise

- Create an `index.html` file housing your complete Calculator App.
- Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

```

Please build the Calculator App inside a single index.html integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```

## Phase 2: Code Refactoring

After validating your single file app, refactor your code by separating concerns into different files:

1. **HTML**: Retain the structure in `index.html`.
2. **CSS**: Move styles to `css/styles.css`.
3. **JavaScript**: Place all script logic in `js/app.js`.

### Exercise

- Create the folder structure and files:
  - `/css/styles.css`
  - `/js/app.js`
  - Update `/index.html` to link both external CSS and JavaScript files.
- Verify that the Calculator App continues to function as expected.

```

Refactor the project into three files and ensure all functionalities work without errors.
```

## Success Criteria

✅ The Calculator App performs all arithmetic operations correctly  
✅ The merged code from individual files works seamlessly  
✅ The refactored project exhibits a clear separation of responsibilities
